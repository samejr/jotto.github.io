                    <br>
                    <p>As a regular player of online scrabble and Words With Friends (and founder of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id972072632?pt=117264455&ct=qiktionary.comseopages&mt=8">Qiktionary</a> – The 4-letter Word Game by Four Letter Works, I enjoy the kind of disjointed relationship with strangers that can only be cultivated in our newly-connected world. Some are true friends; some of them seem to have a prison number rather than a name; others a nickname; others a version of themselves that includes a photograph of their cat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Whatever their names, we speak a lot. I say 'speak' in that we exchange words on a very regular basis. But like the names of my posse, the words too are disjointed, unrelated and non-sequential.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But I'm OK with this... until I sense to spectre of the Scrabble Word Finder.  And then my blood starts to boil.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Scrabble Word Finder is an invisible and sinister temptress. At its most basic, Scrabble Word Finder is a piece of software that generates plausible words based on a random selection of letters inputted into its demonic algorithm. So Scrabble Word Finder is a cheating machine. Fine, cheats lie at the heart of the digital gaming economy. I have no problem with it in that regard.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But Scrabble Word Finder is a more toxic influence than this. It subverts the whole ethos of online Scrabble and Words With Friends by creating distrust amongst us players - cheaters and non-cheaters.  Last week, I landed a 7-letter word on a gentleman with whom I had played 3 or 4 games.  It was an unusual word, but not implausibly so for a 50 year old man who studied Latin and has been tackling the Times cryptic crossword every day since he was 22.  Suddenly 'Nice wee cheat' appeared as a message sent from my opponent. Every defensive hackle I own was raised. 'Me? Using a Scrabble Word Finder?  What?' I over-reacted to the accusation shamefully and blocked my opponent from any future head-to-heads.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Of course, I have been in a similar position. An opponent has gone from words such as DUNE, QI or CAT to ZEUGMAS and I smell the work of the Scrabble Word Finder.  Personally, I look at it as another level of challenge. If I can beat that Scrabble Word Finder and the opponent, then I've been lucky with my letters, for sure.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But how much better a world where a Scrabble Word Finder was banned, flagged and vilified. The Scrabble Word Finder has no place in a social gaming context because of its power to create distrust.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Join me in the online revolution to have them banned forever.</p>
